We've added a deprecation notice as well.\r\n- **[#31439](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/31439) removes `flex: 1 0 100%` from `.row`s.** This was added to address shrinking rows inside the navbar component after our responsive containers were added in v4.4.0. Removing this rolls us back to the expected grid and flex behaviorâ€”your row will shrink unfortunately without further changes. We could add extra custom CSS to address this, but it seems shortsighted to rush into that. Instead, apply `.flex-fill` to the `.row` and your row will behave as usual."

Remember that with every minor and major release of Bootstrap, we ship a new URL for our hosted docs to ensure URLs continue to work.- **New responsive containers!** Over a year in the making, fluid up to a particular breakpoint, available for all responsive tiers.\r\n\r\n- **New responsive `.row-cols` classes** for quickly specifying the number of columns across breakpoints. This one is huge for those of you who have asked for responsive card decks.\r\n- **New `escape-svg()` function** for simplifying our embedded `background-image` SVGs for forms and more.\r\n- **New `add()` and `subtract()` functions** for avoiding errors and zero values from CSS's built in `calc` feature.\r\n- **New `make-col-auto()` mixin** to make our `.col-auto` class available with custom HTML.\r\n- Fixed an issue with Microsoft Edge not picking up `:disabled` styles by moving selectors to `[disabled]`.\r\n- **Deprecated:** `bg-variant()`, `nav-divider()`, and `form-control-focus()` mixins are now deprecated as they're going away in v5.\r\n- Updated our spacing and alignment for modal footer elements like buttons to automatically wrap when space is constrained.\r\n- More flexible form control validation styles thanks to fewer chained selectors. Also updated the `:invalid` validation icon to be an alert instead of an `&times;` to avoid confusion with browser functionality for clearing the form field value.\r\n- Fixed a couple dozen CSS and JS bugs.\r\n- Moved to GitHub Actions for CI/CD! Expect more updates to our CI setup over time here while Actions evolves.\r\n- Updated documentation to fix links and typos, improved landmarks for secondary navigation, and a new security doc for guidelines on reporting potential vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\n- [List of closed issues and merged pull requests](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues?q=project%3Atwbs%2Fbootstrap%2F18+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc)\r\n- [Review the project board](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/18)\r\n"

Please try to use [valid selectors](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier) or the `data-target` HTML attribute/`target` option where available.\r\n- **Fixed:** Reverted v4.2.1's change to the breakpoint and grid container Sass maps that blocked folks from upgrading when modifying those default variables.\r\n- **Fixed:** Restored `white-space: nowrap` to `.dropdown-toggle` (before v4.2.1 it was on all `.btn`s) so carets don't wrap to new lines.\r\n- **Deprecated:** `img-retina`, `invisible`, `float`, and `size` mixins are now deprecated and will be removed in v5.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n- [Read the full ship list](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/27893)\r\n- [Review the project board](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/16)"

Disable them with the `$enable-validation-icons` boolean Sass variable (defaults to `true`).\r\n- **New:** Added a new versions page to our docs\r\n- **New:** Tooltips/Popovers work with Shadow DOM\r\n- **Updated:** Redesigned the custom checkboxes and radios for more obvious states.\r\n- **Updated:** `bootstrap-grid.css` now includes our `margin` and `padding` utilities for full control of our grid system.\r\n- **Updated:** Changed auto columns (e.g., `.col-auto`) from `max-width: none` to `max-width: 100%` to prevent content from causing a column to overflow the parent.\r\n- **Updated:** Improved rendering of custom selects, ranges, file input, and more.\r\n\r\nCheckout the full [v4.2.0 ship list](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/26952) and [GitHub project](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/6) for the full details. Up next is [v4.3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/16) with some bugfixes, a few new modifier classes and variables, and some new utilities.\r\n\r\n[Head to to the v4.2.x docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/) to see the latest in action.

This also fixes some IE alignment issues.\r\n- **Improved:** Added `Noto Color Emoji` to our system font stack for better rendering in Linux OSes.\r\n"

    "body": "### Breaking changes\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in [our Beta 2 release](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2017/10/19/bootstrap-4-beta-2/), we needed to make a few more breaking changes in Beta 3. We've summarized them here and in our [migration docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/#beta-3-changes)â€”be sure to read them!\r\n\r\n- **Rewrote native and custom check controls.** Both browser default and custom checkboxes and radios now have simpler markup after removing the `<input>` from the `<label>`. Now, all checkboxes and radios have a parent `<div>` and sibling `<input>` and `<label>` pair. This is essential for form validation and disabled inputs because we can use the input's state to style the label.\r\n\r\n\tIn addition, custom checkbox and radio elements no longer have a `.custom-control-indicator`. This is generated from the new `.custom-control-label`.\r\n\r\n- **Input groups were rewritten** with specific `.input-group-{prepend|append}` classes. The new approach allows us to support validation styles and messages within input groups, while also adding support for custom selects, custom file inputs, and multiple `.form-control`s.\r\n\r\n- **Responsive tables are once again parent classes** to avoid accessiblity issues with changing a `<table>`'s `display`.\r\n\r\n- **Deleted the `.col-form-legend` class**, consolidating it's styles into the `.col-form-label` class.\r\n\r\nRead the [Migration page](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/#beta-3-changes) for further details.\r\n\r\n### More highlights\r\n\r\nIn addition to the breaking changes, we've addressed a few more general issues that may impact your project.\r\n\r\n- Restored `cursor: pointer` to non-disabled links, buttons, `.close`, navbar toggler, and pagination links.\r\n\r\n- Added a new vertically centered modal option with `.modal-dialog-centered`.\r\n\r\n- Added new dropleft and dropright variants for dropdowns in #23860.\r\n\r\n- Our npm package no longer includes any files other than our source and dist JavaScript and CSS files. If you previously relied on our running our scripts via the `node_modules` folder, you'll need to update your build tools.\r\n\r\n- Print styles have moved to bottom of the import stack to properly override styles.\r\n\r\nFor more details on this release's changes, take a look at the [Beta 3 ship list issue](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/24439), as well as the [Beta 3 project](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/10)."

[Read the full ship list for details](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/23278) on what issues were closed and PRs merged.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Highlights\r\n\r\n\r\n- Improved Sass map customization with #23260. With this change, it's now possible to override specific key value pairs instead of resetting the entire map, ideal for color scheme customization.\r\n- Restored grid `.offset-` modifiers in #23445. Originally our intent was to supplement this with our margin utilities, but we underestimated the appeal of fixed number column offsets.\r\n- Remove unnecessary `color` from `.badge`, and it's associated `$badge-color` variable, in #23529.\r\n- Rename `grayscale` function to `gray` to avoid breaking CSS native `grayscale` filter in #23579.\r\n- Renamed `.table-inverse`, `.thead-inverse`, and `.thead-default` to `.*-dark` and `.*-light`, matching our color schemes used elsewhere in #23560.\r\n- Responsive tables now generate classes for each grid breakpoint, meaning we've added `.table-responsive-{sm,md,lg,xl}` to the already present `.table-responsive`. You might need to adjust your usage depending on when you want a table to resize. See #22804.\r\n- Include two new dist files which contain Popper.js inside `bootstrap.bundle.js` and `bootstrap.bundle.min.js`. See #23735.\r\n- Dropped support for Bower as they've deprecated the package manager. See #23568.\r\n- Switched breadcrumbs from `float` to flexbox in #23683.\r\n- Added new CSS variables in #23761.\r\n- Switched to Stylelint in #23572.\r\n- New Theming page in the docs from #23611\r\n- #23943: Changed the `color-yiq` from a mixin that included the `color` property to a function that returns a value, allowing you to use it for any CSS property. For example, instead of `color-yiq(#000)`, you'd write `color: color-yiq(#000);`.\r\n- New and improved theming in #24429.\r\n"

    "body": "Happy New Year! It's our final alpha for Bootstrap 4.\n\n### Details\n- [Read the ship list](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/20939)\n- [Browser the closed milestone](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/milestone/39?closed=1)\n\n### Highlights\n- Flexbox is now on by default, with no fallback! This means we've dropped IE9 support, but with significant savings to our code base, simpler components, and improved customization thanks to the power of flexbox.\n- Rebuilt the navbar with flexbox in mind, leading to some structural changes, but including more flexibility and customization. Includes updated docs, code snippets, more responsive options. All navbars in our examples are also using the latest markup and styles now. Also solves around 10 bugs in the process!\n- Overhauled flexbox utilities and documented them. Replaced all the previous flexbox utilities with new ones that are named after `property: value` pairs (instead of creating new names for things). For example, `.flex-items-between` is now `.justify-content-between` to apply `justify-content: between;`. This also adds tons of new flexbox utilities for `display`, `order`, `wrap`, and more.\n- Revamped navs Sass with flexbox and updated docs. All the `float`s and clearfixs have been removed, `.nav-inline` removed (on account of `display: flex` inlining for us on `.nav`), added fill and justify options, and more.\n- Building on the grid improvements from Alpha 5, you can now customize container padding across grid breakpoints and optionally remove grid gutters with  `.no-gutters`.\n- Similarly, our flexbox grid system has new classes for automatically sizing columns to the size of their content across viewports (e.g., you can now apply `col-xs-6`, `col-md-auto`, and `col-xl-4` to a single element).\n- Grid, display, float, margin, padding, and text utility classes have been significantly overhauled. In addition to all classes now being responsive, the `xs` tier no longer requires a breakpoint abbreviation, making for shorter and more descriptive classes and an easier migration from v3. For example, instead of `.d-xs-none`, it's back to `.d-none` while it remains `.d-{sm,md,lg,xl}-none` for those breakpoints.\n- Renamed some `.active`,  all `.in`, and all `.open` classes for our JavaScript powered components for more consistent naming. For example, instead it's now `.collapse.show` instead of  `.collapse.in` and `.show > .dropdown-menu` instead of `.open > .dropdown-menu` to better communicate the visibility of elements.\n- Refactored carousel with new, simpler styles, better documentation, and less specific selectors.\n- Rewrote progress component without the `<progress>` element due to lack of animations, no support for multiple bars, and no support for labels on the progress bars.\n- Fixed some unescaped `#`s in our SVG data URLs that are used to add vector background-images.\n- Renamed `.tag` back to `.badge`, like v3, to avoid conflicts with common WordPress styles.\n- A number of custom form enhancements and bugfixes were made. Label-less custom radios and cehckboxes, fixed SVG URLs in `background-image`s, and more.\n- Updated Normalize.css to v5.0.0.\n- `.form-check` and `.form-check-inline` now share the same markup. Switch between the two by adding or removing `.form-check-inline` as a modifier.\n- Added support for justified navigation when in flexbox mode.\n- Renamed `_animation.scss` to `_transitions.scss` for clarity.\n- Added new color variables (e.g., `$blue`) for additional customization.\n"

    "body": "**[Be sure to read the blog post for the highlights.](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2014/06/26/bootstrap-3-2-0-released/)**\n\n## New features\n- #12042: Responsive embeds, as seen in SUIT CSS.\n- #12204: Visibility and hidden classes for `block`, `inline-block`, and `inline` elements.\n- #12690: Added ZeroClipboard to provide a Flash-based copy button on all examples to quickly copy snippets of code.\n\n## CSS\n\n#### Misc\n- #12679: Add `.sr-only-focusable` class to provide a focus state for skip nav links.\n- #13194: Update Normalize to v3.0.1.\n- #13649: Add `translate3d` in a few instances to reduce repainting when scrolling.\n- #13737: Reset the `html` `font-size` using pixels instead of percentages.\n\n#### Mixins\n- #12459: Refactor scale mixins to ensure both `.scale(x)` and `.scale(x, y)` work. \n- #12855: Add `.animation-fill-mode()` mixin.\n- #12993: Add a table of contents to `mixins.less` and reorganize things.\n- #12998: Modularized the mixins into separate files. We now have a `mixins` directory in our `less` folder that `@import`s all the mixins into `mixins.less` (for backward compatibility).\n- #13859: Update the `.skew()` mixin to use `skewX(...) skewY(...)` instead of old and deprecated `skew(x,y)` syntax.\n\n#### Grid system\n- #12854, #12863: Properly reset `left` values to `auto` instead of `0` in `.col-*-push-0` and `.col-*-pull-0` grid reset classes.\n- #13616: Add custom grid gutter support to `.container-fixed()`. `.make-row` and `.make-*-col` mixins already had this ability, so this simply completes the package.\n\n#### Images\n- #10073: Add `width: 100% \\9;` to `.img-responsive` to prevent IE10 and below from distorting`<svg>` elements. \n\n#### Typography\n- #12753, #12756: Ensure the `.clearfix` is applied on `.dl-horizontal dd` by moving it out of the media query (Less doesn't respect `:extend()` within media queries).\n- #13449: Increase `.lead` `font-weight` for better readability on mobile.\n- #13671: Add `text-transform` utility classes.\n- #13854: Darken `@gray-light` and `.lead` to meet accessibility guidelines.\n- #13860: Add a new variable for `.dl-horizontal`'s offset.\n\n#### Code\n- #12824: Remove `white-space: nowrap` from `<code>` elements in favor of default `pre-wrap` value for better rendering on narrow viewports.\n- #13351: Add support for nested `kbd` elements.\n\n#### Tables\n- #12722: Scope `.table-responsive` styles to `screen` devices only so they're not cut off when printing from Chrome (Safari is fine, unknown for IE and FF).\n- #12742: Make `.table-responsive` more mixin-friendly.\n- #13013: Ensure table cells with contextual states preserve their styles when used within a hover table.\n- #13375: Remove bottom margin on tables within collapsible panels.\n- #13670: Use `overflow-x: auto;` in responsive tables to hide the scrollbar when it's not needed.\n- #13707: Remove unnecessary `max-width: 100%;` on `<table>`s and place it on `.table`s.\n\n#### Forms\n- #12669: Properly reset `line-height` on all date inputs to ensure Mobile Safari and IE8+ display them correctly.\n- #12759: Make input groups in inline forms use `display: table-cell` so they are sized properly and appear on the same line as intended.\n- #12794: Fix placement of browser-based form validation popovers for `required` attribute. Applies to Firefox and Chrome.\n- #12801: Add padding to the bottom of `.form-control-static` to match height of standard form controls.\n- #12843: Scope label styles for horizontal forms to a media query so their narrow viewport display looks just like a normal form.\n- #12868: Vertically center form feedback icons for large and small inputs. Also reorders our `bootstrap.less` file to place `glyphicons.less` closer to the top of our imports to avoid specificity issues.\n- #13003: Move `padding` on `.radio`s and `.checkbox`s to their immediate `<label>`s to avoid the no-click deadzone caused by negative margin.\n- #13066: Add `z-index` to the form control feedback icons so input groups don't render on top of them.\n- #13099: Fix vertical alignment for all time-based inputs on iOS.\n- #13141: Add a `max-width: 100%;` to `<label>` elements so IE8 wraps text properly.\n- #13320: Fix `.form-control-feedback` position when labels have the `.sr-only` class applied. This makes it super easy to use optional feedback icons with no _visible_ label.\n- #13548: Use `position: absolute;` and an IE8-9 hack to fix checkbox and radio `line-height` problems (and the vertical alignment) that were introduced after #13003.\n- #13651: Update explanatory comment about iOS date/time inputs bug.\n- #13745: Add optional `.disabled` class to set not-allowed cursor on disabled radio and checkbox labels.\n- #13856: Add `.form-group-sm` and `.form-group-lg`.\n- #13872: Always apply padding to `.form-control-static` for proper vertical alignment.\n\n#### Buttons\n- #12937: Darken active button background colors just a bit.\n- #13079: Scope `.open` button state in `.button-variant()` mixin to immediate children.\n- #13549: Use `.opacity()` mixin on button group inputs for IE8 support.\n- #13903: Restore side padding on `.btn-block`.\n\n#### Panels\n- #12683: Remove the `overflow: hidden;` from `.panel-group > .panel` because it apparently serves no purpose and cuts off nested dropdown menus.\n- #12745: Add `@panel-heading-padding` and `@panel-footer-padding` variables for panels.\n- #12822: Scope panel collapse styles to immediate `.panel-body`s only.\n- #13689: Fix double border in panel when a list group is followed by panel footer.\n- #13735: Fix bug where a panel recieve extra top border when placed within a collapsible panel.\n\n#### List groups\n- #12490: Add support for disabled list items in list groups.\n- #12739: Add `@list-group-link-hover-color` variable to customize the text color when hovering on linked list items.\n- #13857: Properly color `<small>`/`.small` within active list group headings.\n\n#### Progress bars\n- #12848: Improve progress bars to better handle low to zero percentage values.\n- #13861: Refactor striped and animated striped progress bars to deprecate the required parent class and add new modifier classes.\n\n#### Badges\n- #12969: Improve badge mixinability with better nesting.\n- #13687: Colorize badges in panel headings.\n\n#### Navbar\n- #12738: Revamps navbar collapse functionality. Instead of setting a `max-height` on all `.navbar-collapse` elements, we only apply it to fixed top and bottom navbars. Also adds a shorter `max-height` for landscape views to ensure scrolling still works.\n- #12694, #12813: Correctly reset `.btn-link` colors in a navbars.\n\n#### Dropdowns\n- #13037: Add `text-align: left;` to `.dropdown-menu` to avoid inheritance from any parent that might reset that property (e.g., our `.modal-footer`).\n- #13369: Fix dropdown menu alignment in justified button groups in Firefox.\n- #13851: Add `white-space: nowrap;` to `.dropdown-header` to match dropdown links.\n\n#### Tooltips and popovers\n- #12934, #12952: Base rounded corners on popover titles on the `@border-radius-large` variable.\n- #13216, #13217: Increase `z-index` values on tooltips and popovers to always be in front of modals.\n\n#### Modals\n- #12803: Removed unnecessary top margin from `.modal-footer`. All spacing is addressed by `padding` on the `.modal-body`, and the `.modal-header` never had any `margin` on it.\n- 7e551ecaf7: Update padding on modals to be `15px` all around. Previously was `15px` in the header and `20px` everywhere else.\n- #13609: Update modal CSS to prevent shifting before animation.\n\n#### Collapse\n- #12593: Add support to Collapse plugin for `tr`s and `tbody`s.\n\n#### Carousel\n- #13242: Fix horizontal alignment of carousel controls by using appropriate margin for each side.\n\n#### Theme\n- #13093: Reset the `background-color` and `background-image` on disabled theme buttons.\n\n#### Glyphicons\n- #13542: Fixes #13478 by reverting #10941.

We call it the [Wall of browser bugs](http://getbootstrap.com/browser-bugs). We've also documented a few new bugs with this release:\n- #10690: Reported a bug in Firefox for responsive images (those with `max-width: 100%`) in table cells. No other browsers are affected. See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=975632. Until a fix is shipped, add `width: 100%;` to your responsive images in table cells.\n- #12548: Reported a bug in Chrome where date inputs stop resizing when appearing with `display: table-cell;`. See https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=346051.\n- #12476: Document IE8's limitation of borders on buttons in a justified button group. Currently the only way to get borders on those buttons is to wrap each button in an additional `.btn-group`, just like the button groups using `<button>` elements.\n"

    "body": "### New features\n- Three new templates: Blog, Cover, and Dashboard.\n- #10884: Add `.info` variant to contextual table classes.\n- #11138: Add contextual styles to list groups.\n- #11162: Add new sizes, `.modal-lg` and `.modal-sm`, to modals for quicker settings on modals. Only applies to modals above the small breakpoint.\n- #11193: Add `<kbd>` element styles to indicate user input via keyboard.\n- #11244: Add `.animation()` mixins.\n- #11572: Add contextual `background-color` classes to match our existing text classes. (This also moves both sets of classes to the Helper Classes section of the CSS docs.)\n- #11675: Add `.text-justify` class to round out the text alignment classes.\n- #11836: Add new form control feedback classes to toggle icons for each validation state. Works on regular forms, horizontal, and inline.\n\nWhile we originally wanted v3.1 to include RTL support, we decided to hold back on that for some potentially beneficial unreleased tooling. We'll share more on that when we know more, but suffice to say it's been bumped to v3.2.\n\n### CSS changes\n- #10951: Add `outline: 0` to `.modal` to prevent a focus outline from appearing in Chrome for Windows.\n- #11107: Add `@modal-backdrop-opacity` variable for customizable modal backdrop.\n- #11266: Apply a pixel-based `line-height` that matches the `height` to date inputs for iOS 7 for proper vertical alignment of text in the form control.\n- #11286: Add `@well-border` variable.\n- #11302: Refactor the responsive utility classes to cut a few hundred lines of CSS (more context in #11214).\n- #11435: Prevent the double borders between multiple buttons in an input group.\n- #11561: Add `float: left;` to `.form-control`s within input groups to prevent IE9 from screwing up placeholder text and select menu arrows.\n- #11588: Scope `font-size` to only `<p>` elements in `.jumbotron`s and remove the super-sized `line-height` from the base class to avoid interference with sub-components.\n- #11676: Add `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;` to modals for smooth scrolling on iOS devices.\n- #11744: Clean up some incompatible properties in `forms.less`: block level inputs no longer receive `vertical-align: middle;` unless necessary, e.g. in inline forms.\n- #11748: Updated `.scale()` mixin so that it accepts optional vertical scale as second parameter.\n- #11750: Reverts v3.0.3's refactor to contextual table classes to ensure they work with striped tables.\n- #11757: Darken default navbar toggle bars to meet WCAG criteria.\n- #11766: Use `@color` variable in `.button-variant()` mixin to set `background-color` on `.badge`s in buttons for proper default button badge styles.\n- #11741: Don't set `@headings-font-family` to the same font stack as the `<body>`; instead, just use `inherit` for same default CSS.\n- #11786: Nest media queries within print utilities for mixin-friendliness.\n- #11790: With switch to LESS compiler, remove duplicate CSS generated from the nested `.clearfix` class and mixin by switching to `&:extend(.clearfix all)`.\n- #11801: Use correct variables for grid containers.\n- #11817: Rework input groups to use the `font-size: 0;` and `white-space: nowrap` hack for a more durable component with regards to code formatting and custom font size changes.\n- #11829: Add `.make-xs-column` mixins to complement the recently added extra small predefined grid classes.\n- #11836: Along with the form validation update, we reset some key form and icon styles:\n  - All `.form-control`s within inline forms are set to `width: auto;` to prevent stacking of `.form-label` within a `.form-group`.\n  - Removes all `select.form-control` settings since those are now inherited by the above change\n  - Removes the `width: 1em;` from the Glyphicons because it was virtually impossible to override.\n- #11841: Breadcrumb padding values now use variables.\n- #11859: Restore `@dropdown-caret-color` variable, but deprecate it.\n- #11861: Add `@list-group-active-text-color` variable for improved customization on active list group items.\n- #11868: Cleanup modal `z-index` values in `modals.less`.\n- Updated `<blockquote>` to no longer thing text or modify `line-height` for improved readability.\n- #11990, #12159: Make range inputs block level and 100% wide by default.\n- #12073: Make order of component variations consistent throughout the repo.\n- #12164: Fix value of SVG font ID and removed hard coded value.\n- #12171: Ensure panel groups have a bottom margin since we nuke it on child panels.\n- #12247: Add and use `.text-emphasis-variant()` mixin for emphasis classes. Also updated emphasis classes to only apply `:hover` styles to linked content.\n- #12248: Add and use `.bg-variant()` mixin to generate background classes.\n- #12249: Add and use `@modal-md` Less variable for uniformity.\n- #12250: Remove print `margin`s per upstream H5BP change, thus deferring to browser defaults,  or users' custom values should they set them.\n- #12286: Only remove appropriate `border-radius` from first and last tables or list groups in panels.\n- #12353: Scope table border reset in panels to first-child rows.\n- #12359: Reset `min-width` on `<fieldset>`s so they don't break responsive tables and behave more like standard block level elements.\n- #12406: Upgrade to Normalize v3.\n- #12422: Reset height on `select[multiple]` in `.input-size()` mixin.\n- #12424: Given Normalize v3 upgrade, account for change on `<figure>` element so that we don't cause backward compatibility issues.\n- #12388: Apply a fixed `height` to `.navbar-brand` to ensure adding a Glyphicon doesn't increase it's height.\n\n### JavaScript changes\n- #9318, #9459, #10105: Properly place remote content within the `.modal-content` instead of `.modal-body` (see note below).\n- #10044: Check that `href` id's are followed by valid characters in dropdowns.\n- #10134: Don't use jQuery `offset` directly because it uses sub pixel rendering.\n- #10199: Correct `hidden.bs` and `shown.bs` events firing too early in tooltips and popovers.\n- #10205: Enable support of Chinese characters in Scrollspy targets.\n- #10236: Properly calculate offset positioning for affix plugin when reloading a scrolled window.\n- #10260, #10568, #10740: Properly hide tooltips and popovers if no animation is set.\n- #10283: Prevent IE8 from complaining about `$.support.transition.end`.\n- #10327: Correctly reset carousel when the slide event is prevented.\n- #10359: Pass `$element` to offset top/bottom calc funcs for better dynamic offsets.\n- #10658: Don't let popover content lose bound events on second `setContent` call.\n- #10675: Ensure scrollspy target in tab content works properly.\n- #10709: Be consistent about type of quotes in our JSâ€”switches double quotes to single quotes throughout.\n- #10761: Don't create new tooltip/popover objects just to destroy them immediately.\n- #10798: Modal namespacing.\n- #10801: Restore `.collapse` to `.in` after collapsing animation finishes in collapse plugin.\n- #10834: Only `preventDefault` on click on `[data-toggle=\"modal\"]` when the element is a link.\n- #10890: Calling `$().button(state)` shouldn't enable a disabled button.\n- #10911: Add `loaded` event for use with modal's `remote` option.\n- #10921: Input groups within button toolbars are now supported.\n- #11203: Improve scrollspy's handling of hidden targets.\n- #11288: Save vertical scroll position of modal between openings.\n- #11362: Update affix and scrollspy on speedy scroll to top of page.\n- #11373: Add related target to dropdown events.\n- #11379: Fix carousel `this.sliding` not getting reset if `$next.hasClass('active')`.\n- #11416: Use the transition duration from the CSS for the carousel.\n- #11496: Clear tooltip timeout on destroy.\n- #11555: Add `@tooltip-opacity` variable.\n- #11720: Add events (affix, affixed, affix-top, etc) to affix plugin.\n- #11722: Use document scroll height instead of offset height in affix plugin.\n- #11788: Use `focusin`/`focusout` instead of `focus`/`blur` for tooltip and popover focus trigger for Firefox and Safari.\n- #11825: Add dropdown ARIA roles.\n- #12270: Add namespace `.bs` also to the event `dismiss.modal`.\n\n#### Remote modal content\n\nIf you currently use the modal's `remote` option, be aware this release may break your modals. Yes, this is a breaking change, but it's first and foremost a **bug fix** one that corrects a rather longstanding and overlooked error. Our apologies for any headaches it may cause, but it's been missed in the last few patch releases.\n\nSee the #11933 pull request for details on the code changes.\n\n### Deprecations\n- #10370: Deprecated the `.pull-right` method for aligning dropdown menus. Includes the following changes:\n  - Removed an old and unused pair of selectors that didnâ€™t properly target the right-aligned navbar alignment of dropdown menus.\n  - Deprecates the `.pull-right` alignment in favor of a more specific and unique class name.\n  - Adds `.dropdown-menu-right` as the new alignment class. This is then mixin-ed into the `.navbar-right.navbar-nav` dropdown menus for auto-alignment (keeping the current behavior we have today).\n  - Adds new ability to override that auto-alignment though with the new `.dropdown-menu-left`, which is mixin-ed in the same way to provide the appropriate specificity of an override. This should never need to be used except for within right-aligned `.navbar-nav` components.\n- #11660: Deprecate `small` and `.small` in `blockquote` citation in favor of `footer` element.\n- #12398: Deprecate `.box-shadow()` mixin.\n\n### Documentation\n- #10486: Add note about `data-toggle` dropdown dependency.\n- #10505: Document more of our LESS variables and mixins (not all, but the commonly used ones).\n- #11158: Customizer's variables are now generated via Grunt task from the `variables.less` file.\n- #11447: Document that modal remote URL is only loaded once.\n- #11655: Normalize disabled inputs and buttons in iOS with `opacity: 1;`.\n- #11723: Mention removal of `.pill-content` and `.pill-pane` in the migration guide.\n- #11738, #11765: Load minified assets in the docs to improve performance.\n- #11742: Add link to French translation in About page (v3.0.3 saw Ukrainian added as well).\n- #11760: Remove mailing list links from readme and about pages.\n- #11764: Add `meta` tags to docs for description, keywords, and authors.\n- #11770: Move component-animations.less to the utility section of import list to match Customizer\n- #11830, #11832: More help for Windows users installing Jekyll with requirement of Python and link to [@juthilo](https://github.com/juthilo)'s guide, [Run Jekyll on Windows](https://github.com/juthilo/run-jekyll-on-windows/).\n- #11876: Enable `failHard` grunt-html-validation option.\n- #11977: Concatenate and minify all docs assets.\n- #12037: Move docs `.html` pages and assets into `docs/` subfolder to clean up project root directory. Also moves `.csscomb.json` and `.csslintrc` to `less/` to further clean up project root.\n- Updated browser and device support documentation:\n  - #11055: add mention of select menu styling on Android stock browsers with included optional fix.\n  - Update IDs and docs nav to include bookmark links to each section.\n  - Add callout to navbar docs about fixed position, inputs, and virtual keyboard.\n- #12073: Make order of component variations consistent throughout the repo.\n- #12244: Move v2.x to v3.x migration docs to a separate page.\n- #12311: Expand information on how to handle overflowing content in navbars.\n- #12314: Add warning about modal markup placement affecting modal appearance/functionality.\n- #12345: Add note about printer viewport weirdness.\n- #12380: Add link to unofficial German translation, http://holdirbootstrap.de.\n\n### Build system & packaging\n- #11761: Add JavaScript Code Style checker integration.\n- #11739: Lint `docs-assets/js/application.js` and `docs-assets/js/customizer.js`.\n- #11780: Don't ignore `Gruntfile.js` or `package.json` in `bower.json` as they're required for compilation.\n- #11790: Switch from Recess to LESS compiler.\n  - Dropped `grunt-recess` for `grunt-contrib-less` to get the latest version of LESS (v1.5.x) since Recess was still quite behind.\n  - Adds CSScomb to take place of Recess's CSS linting. Includes custom `.csscomb.json` in project root with basically the same property order as Recess.\n  - Fixes duplicate CSS generation from the nested `.clearfix` class and mixin by switching to `&:extend(.mixin all)` (also mentioned in changes section).\n  - Compiled CSS looks only slightly differentâ€”yay!\n- #11804: Enable CSS source maps in `grunt-contrib-less`.\n- #12003: Customizer now compiles `theme.less` with updated values.\n- #12315: Add npm caching based on `npm-shrinkwrap.canonical.json`.\n"

    "body": "## What's new\n\nFor those who haven't been following along too closely, here's a recap of all the biggest changes shipping with Bootstrap 3:\n- **New design and an optional theme!** With v3, we've gone flat. Don't call it a trendâ€”it's all about customization, folks. Since we simplified the aesthetics though, we thought it'd help to have an optional theme. To use it, check out the [Bootstrap theme example](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/theme/).\n- **Mobile first and always responsive!** Nearly everything has been redesigned and rebuilt to start from your handheld devices and scale up.\n- **Brand new Customizer!** It's been redesigned, is now compiled in the browser instead of Heroku, has better dependency support, and even has built-in error handling. Better yet, we now save your customizations to an anonymous Gist for easy reuse, sharing, and modifications.\n- **Better box model by default.** Everything in Bootstrap gets `box-sizing: border-box`, making for easier sizing options and an enhanced grid system.\n- **Super-powered grid system.** With four tiers of grid classesâ€”phones, tablets, desktops, and large desktopsâ€”you can do some super crazy awesome layouts.\n- **Rewritten JavaScript plugins.** All events are now namespaced, no-conflict stuff works way better, and more.\n- **New Glyphicons icon font!** While they were gone for a while, we've since restored the Glyphicons to the main repo. In 2.x, they were images, but now they're in font format and include 40 new glyphs.\n- **Overhauled navbar.** It's now always responsive and comes with some super handy and re-arrangable subcomponents.\n- **Modals are way more responsive.** We've overhauled the modal code to make it way more responsive on mobile devices. They now scroll the entire viewport instead of having a max-height.\n- **Added some components!** New to the mix are panels and list groups.\n- **Removed some components!** We've dropped the accordion (replaced with collapsible panels), submenus, typeahead, and a few more small items. (Worth celebrating as much as adding new ones.)\n- **More consistent base and sizing classes.** Buttons, tables, forms, alerts, and more have been updated to have more consistent classes for easier customizer and extensibility.\n- **Docs have been blown up, yo.** We've added a lot of new documentation, not only for our components, but for browser support (including gotchas and bugs), license FAQs, third party support (and workarounds), accessibility, and more.\n- **Dropped Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 3.6 support.** For Internet Explorer 8, you'll need to include [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) for all the media queries to work correctly. You can read more about [browser support](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browser-support) in the docs.\n\nFor our pre-release testers and others who have been following along with the RCs, here's a list of some of the more prominent changes made since RC2:\n- Hella bugs have been fixed (duh, right?).\n- Restored the Glyphicons icon font.\n- Navbars now require a `.navbar-default` for the standard version.\n- Panels now require a `.panel-default` for the standard gray variation.\n- Alerts now require a modifier class (e.g., `.alert.alert-warning` for the previously default yellow alert).\n- Multiple responsive utilities can now be applied to the same element.\n- Examples are back in the main repo and have been fully updated.\n- Docs have been updated for more consistent placement, naming, etc.\n- Customizer compiling bugs have all been fixed.\n- The optional theme has been added and is demonstrated in an example.\n- Jumbotrons are now made to extend the full width of the viewport with a container inside, but if you reverse that, the jumbotron in a container will be rounded and padded.\n- The navbar components have been updated to better account for the presence of containers and more. You'll see some new margin and padding changes, but no markup changes should be required.\n\nThanks everyone! <3\n\n(P.S. The dist download here includes compiled CSS, JS, and fonts onlyâ€”no source code or docs.)\n"

    "body": "### Overview\r\n\r\nSecond release candidate for the upcoming Bootstrap 3. For a complete set of changes between RC1 and RC1, see the commit logs. Key changes are summarized below. To check it out, visit [http://getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com) or use one of the download options below.\r\n\r\nThere's no dedicated ZIP file for the compiled CSS and JSâ€”that falls out of date too quickly.\r\n\r\n**To stay up to date, [download the latest 3.0.0-wip](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/archive/3.0.0-wip.zip)** instead of the download options below.\r\n\r\n### Key changes\r\n- **Docs changes:**\r\n  - The Customizer is back! Still needs some work, but functionality has been rewritten and will be improved as we head to final release.\r\n  - Added new mention to our [browser compatibility docs](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers) to highlight the workaround for Internet Explorer 10 in Windows Phone 8 not picking up media queries. [See #9171.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9171)\r\n  - Added new section to the Getting Started page for documenting [third party and addon compatibility](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#third-parties) issues. [See #9175.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9175)\r\n  - Added [new Accessibility section](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#accessibility), lots of new aria and role attributes, and more for improved 508 and WCAG compliancy. [See #9186.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9186) Also improved used of more semantic HTML5 elements in docs per [#9332](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9332), [#9347](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9347), and [#9352](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9352).\r\n  - Added HTML validation tests, and made any existing failures pass. [See #9396.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9396)\r\n- **Global CSS changes:**\r\n  - Update vertical and horizontal gradients to make start and end color parameters come first, then start and end positions. [Fixes #9049.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9049)\r\n  - Make `.pull-right` and `.pull-left` classes use `!important` to avoid needing overrides due to specificity (like in navbar, button groups, etc). [See #8697.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/8697)\r\n  - Lots of variable additions to components.\r\n  - Updated gradients to not include `background-color` for improved use of `rgba()` colors within mixins. [See #8877](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/8877)\r\n- **Grid system:**\r\n  - Overhauled grid system to include four tiers instead of the original three of RC1. We now have `.col-xs` (phones), `.col-sm` (tablets), `.col-md` (desktops), and `.col-lg` (large desktops). Responsive utilities have been updated to match these new tiers as well. [See relevant commit](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/commit/a2b9988eb908e5b95fb253aac7fde0fbd61c375e).\r\n  - `.row`s only have negative left and right margins if they sit within a `.container`. This resolves the horizontal scrollbar issue for folks with full page containers (restoring the full behavior of the old fluid container from 2.x). [See #8959.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/8959)\r\n  - Grid now includes offset, push, and pull classes for each break point [See #8974.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/8974)\r\n  - Updated mixins to include ability to specify gutter width as a second parameter. [See #8935.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/8935)\r\n- **Buttons:**\r\n  - Buttons and inputs, and their large counterparts, are now a bit shorter.\r\n  - New default button styles and higher contrast on `:hover` and `:active` states. [Fixes #8786.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/8786)\r\n  - New classes for size modifier classesâ€”instead of `.btn-mini`, `.btn-small`, or `.btn-large`, we now have `.btn-xs`, `.btn-sm`, and `.btn-lg`. [See #9056.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9056)\r\n  - New button group sizing classes: just add `.btn-group-xs`, `.btn-group-sm`, or `.btn-group-lg` to any `.btn-group` and you're good to go. [See #9295.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9295)\r\n- **Forms:**\r\n  - Similar to the new button classes, we have new input size classes: `.input-sm` and `.input-lg`. [See #9056.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9056)\r\n  - Input focus states now generated via variable and mixin. Use the `@input-focus-border` variable and `.form-control-focus` mixin to generate a custom `border-color` and `box-shadow`. \r\n- Size modifier classes for large and small componentsâ€”including buttons, form inputs, pagination, and wellsâ€”have all been standardized to use `-sm` or `-lg`. [See #9056.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9056)\r\n  - Inline forms now require the use of `.form-group`, [per #9382](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9382), to properly align and size all (native and custom) form controls. This also helps make form markup more consistent and flexible (just swap a class), so woohoo!\r\n  - Added `.static-form-control` to account for static, placeholder text in horizontal form layouts. [Fixes #8150.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/8150)\r\n  - New input group sizing classes: just add `.input-group-sm` or `.input-group-lg` to any `.input-group` and you're good to go. [See #9295.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9295)\r\n- **Dropped accordion for updated panel.**\r\n  - We've removed the accordion and instead chosen to extend the panel component to provide the same functionality. [See #9404](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9404).\r\n- **Navbar:**\r\n  - Overhauled navbar to always be responsive and mobile first.\r\n    - Navbars now require a `.navbar-header` to wrap up brand and toggle.\r\n    - `.nav-collapse` has been renamed to `.navbar-collapse` and automatically hits a max-height and will overflow to keep your nav content in the same viewport.\r\n    - [See details in #9403.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9403)\r\n  - Navbar's no longer use `.pull-left` or `.pull-right`, but rather `.navbar-left` and `.navbar-right`. This avoids issues with specificity due to chaining classes and enables easier styling.\r\n- **Miscellaneous component changes:**\r\n  - Alerts that are to be dismissed now require `.alert-dismissable` to properly pad the alert and align the close button. [See #9310](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9310).\r\n  - Responsive utilities are now mixin-able thanks to [#9211](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9211).\r\n  - Dropped `.alert-block` for a simpler `.alert`.\r\n  - Linked panel titles now inherit their color. Fixes [#9061](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9061).\r\n  - List groups in panels no longer require `.list-group-flush`.\r\n  - Labels now require `.label-default` for the \"default\" gray option. [See #9123.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9123)\r\n  - Labels now collapse automatically (not in IE8) when empty. [See #9241.](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9241)\r\n"

Now getting started is way easierâ€”just run `npm install`.\n  - Upgraded to jQuery 1.9. No changes were needed, but we did upgrade the included jQuery file to the latest release.\n  - Moved changelog to be within the repo instead of as a wiki page.\n- **New and improved features:**\n  - **Added carousel indicators!** Add the HTML and it automagically works.\n  - **Added `container` option to tooltips.** The default option is still `insertAfter`, but now you may specify where to insert tooltips (and by extension, popovers) with the optional container parameter.\n  - Improved popovers now utilize `max-width` instead of `width`, have been widened from 240px to 280px, and will automatically hide the title if one has not been set via CSS `:empty` selector.\n  - Improved tooltip alignment on edges with [#6713](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6713).\n  - **Improved accessibility for links in all components.** After merging [#6441](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6441), link hover states now apply to the `:focus` state as well. This goes for basic `<a>` tags, as well as buttons, navs, dropdowns, and more.\n  - Added print utility classes to show and hide content between `screen` and `print` via CSS.\n  - Updated input groups to make them behave more like default form controls. Added `display: inline-block;`, increased `margin-bottom`, and added `vertical-align: middle;`  to match `<input>` styles.\n  - Added `.horizontal-three-colors()` gradient mixin (with example in the CSS tests file).\n  - Added `.text-left`, `.text-center`, and `.text-right` utility classes for easy typographic alignment.\n  - Added `@ms-viewport` so IE10 can use responsive CSS when in split-screen mode.\n- **Docs changes:**\n  - Added [new justified navigation example](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/98681/25869/5e2f812c-4afa-11e2-9293-501cd689232d.png).\n  - Added sticky footer with fixed navbar example.\n\nSee more on the [2.3.0 pull request](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6346).\n"

    "body": "- New feature: alert text. We documented these new classes, like `.text-success`, at the bottom of the [Typography section](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#typography) along with the long undocumented `.muted`.\n- Fixed a lot of typos in the docs. Spelling is hard.\n- Made the `.box-shadow()` mixin more durable. It no longer requires escaping for multiple shadows, meaning you can easily use variables and functions in them once again.\n- Widened `.dl-horizontal dt` and `.horizontal-form .control-group` to better handle the increased font-size.\n- Dropdown submenus improved: now you only see the next level, not all levels, on hover of the submenu toggle.\n- Clarified jQuery and Bootstrap template requirements in Getting Started section.\n- `select` now utilizes `@inputBorder`.\n- `.lead` now scales up from `@baseFontSize` instead of being a fixed font-size and line-height.\n- Fixed the vertical three color gradient in latest Firefox.\n- Reordered some variables that caused errors in certain Less compilers.\n"

Instead of a generic `input` selector and various resets, we target each type of input like `input[type=\"text\"]`, `input[type=\"password\"]`, etc.\n- Form field state (e.g., success or error) now applies to checkbox and radio labels.\n- Removed redundant CSS on `<p>` for `font-family`, `font-size`, and `line-height`.\n- Removed redundant `color` declaration from the `<label>` element.\n- Added variables for dropdown dividers border colors.\n- `legend` and `.form-actions` share the same `border-color`, `#e5e5e5`.\n- Fixed some responsive issues with input-prepend and -append, notably with the fluid grid.\n- Added special CSS to prevent `max-width: 100%;` on images from messing up Google Maps rendering.\n- Scope opened dropdowns to only immediate children to avoid unintended cascade.\n- Similarly, scope floated-right dropdowns to immediate children with `.pull-right > .dropdown-menu`.\n- Updated `.placeholder()` mixin to use `&` operator in Less for proper output when compiling.\n- Added `-ms-input-placeholder` to `.placeholder()` mixin.\n- Added CSS3 hyphens mixin.\n- Fixed a bug in IE7/8 where certain form controls would not show text if the parent had a filter opacity set.\n"

    "body": "### HTML and CSS\n- Overhauled the responsive utility classes to simplify required CSS, add `!important` to all declarations, and use `display: inherit` in place of `display: block` to account for different types of elements.\n- Removed `>` from fluid grid column selectors, meaning every element with a `.span*` class within a `.row-fluid` will use percentage widths instead of fixed-pixels.\n- Fixed regression in responsive images support as of 2.0.1. We've re-added `max-width: 100%;` to images by default. We removed it in our last release since we had folks complaining about Google Maps integration and other projects, but we're taking a different stance now on these things and will require developers to make these tweaks on their end.\n- Added variable `@navbarBrandColor` for the brand element in navbars, which defaults to `@navbarLinkColor`.\n- Font-family mixins now use variables for their stacks.\n- Fixed an unescaped `filter` on the `.reset-filter()` mixin that was causing some errors depending on your compiler.\n- Fixed regression in `.form-actions` background, which was too dark, by adding a new variable `@formActionsBackground` and changing the color to `#f5f5f5` instead of `#eee`.\n- Fixed an issue on button group dropdowns where the background color was not using the button's darker color when the dropdown is open.\n- Generalized and simplified the open dropdown classes while adding smarter defaults. Instead of `.dropdown.open`, we now use just `.open`. On the defaults side, all dropdown menus now have rounded corners to start.\n- Improved active `.dropdown-toggle` styles (for dropdown buttons) by darkening the background and sharpening the inset shadow to match the active state of buttons.\n- Direction of animation on progress bars reversed.\n- Fixed input-prepend/append issue with uneditable inputs: `.uneditable-input` was being floated and a missing comma meant its `border-radius` for the append option wasn't being applied properly.\n- Removed `height: auto;` from `img` since it was overriding dimensions set via HTML attributes.\n- Fixed an issue of double borders on the top of tables with captions or colgroups.\n- Fixed issue with anchor buttons in the `.navbar-text`. Instead of a general styling on all anchors within an element with that class, we now have a new class to specifically apply appropriate link color.\n- Added support for `@navbarHeight` on the brand/project name and nav links for complete navbar height customization.\n- Fixed the black borders on buttons problem in IE7 by removing the border, increasing the line-height, and providing darker background colors.\n- Removed excess padding on `.search-query` inputs in IE7 since it doesn't have border-radius.\n- Updated alert messages in Components to use `button` elements as close icons instead of `a`. Both can be used, but an `a` will require `href=\"#\"` for dismissal on iOS devices.\n- Fixed an issue with prepended/appended inputs in Firefox where `select` elements required two clicks to toggle the dropdown. Resolved by moving the `position: relative` to the `select` by default instead of on `:focus`.\n- Added a new mixin, `.backface-visibility`, to help refine CSS 3D tranforms. Examples and explanation of usage can be found on [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/backface-visibility/).\n- Changed specificity of grid classes in responsive layouts under 767px to accurately target `input`, `select`, and `textarea` elements that use `.span*` classes.\n- Horizontal description lists, `.dl-horizontal`, now truncate terms that are too long to fit in their fixed-width column. In the < 767px responsive layout, they change to their default stacked layout.\n- Changed tabbable tabs to prevent issues in left and right aligned tabs. `.tab-content` would not growing to its parent's full width due to `display: table`. We removed that and the `width: 100%` and instead just set `overflow: auto` to clear the left and right aligned tabs.\n- Updated thumbnails to support fluid grid column sizing.\n- Added `>` to most of the button group selectors\n- Added new variable, `@inputBorderRadius`, to all form controls that previously made use of the static `3px` value everywhere.\n- Changed the way we do `border-radius` for tables. Instead of the regular mixin that zeros out all other corners, we specify one corner only so they can be combined for use on single column table headers.\n- Updated Glyphicons Halflings from 1.5 to 1.6, introducing 20 new icons.\n- Added an `offset` paramater to the `.makeColumn`.\n- Increased the specificity of all tabbable nav selectors to include `.nav-collapse` to appropriately scope the responsive navbar behavior.\n- Fixed uneditable inputs: text now cuts off and does not wrap, making it behave just like a default `input`.\n- Labels and badges are now `vertical-align: baseline;` so they line up with surrounding text.\n\n### Javascript\n- Add jshint support\n- Add travis-ci support w/ headless phantom integration\n- Replace UA sniffing in bootstrap-transitions.js\n- Add MSTransitionEnd event to transition plugin\n- Fix pause method in carousel (shouldn't restart when hovering over controls)\n- Fix crazy opera bug #1776\n- Don't open dropdown if target element is disabled\n- Always select last item in scrollspy if you've reached the bottom of the document or element\n- Typeahead should escape regexp special chars\n- If interval is false on carousel, do not auto-cycle\n- Add preventDefault support for all initial event types (show, close, hide, etc.)\n- Fix collapse bug in ie7+ for initial collapse in\n- Fix nested collapse bug\n- If transitioning collapse, don't start new transition\n- Try to autodetect when to use html/text method in tooltip/popovers to help prevent xss\n- Add bootstrap + bootstrap.min.js to gh-pages for @remy and jsbin support\n\n### Documentation and repo\n- Combined badges and labels into a single LESS file, labels-badges.less, to reduce repeated CSS.\n- Separated responsive features into multiple files. We now have a file for each grouping of media queries (tablets and down, tablets to desktops, and large desktops). Additionally, the visible/hidden utility classes and the responsive navbar are in their own files. The output is the same in the compiled CSS, but this should give folks a bit more flexibility.\n- Added a new CSS Tests page in the docs (not in the top nav) for better testing of edge cases and extending the use of standard components.\n- Removed the bootstrap.zip file from the repo and the make process for faster building and a lighter repo. From now on, the zip will only be in the documentation branch.\n- Fixed incorrect use of class instead of ID for tabs example and added documentation for multiple ways of toggling tabs.\n- Fixed required markup listed for the specialized navbar search field.\n- Removed all mention of `@siteWidth`, a variable no longer in use.\n- Removed mentions of unused `@buttonPrimaryBackground` variable, which is no longer in use.\n- Updated LESS docs page to include all the new variables we added in previous releases.\n- Removed broken \"dropup\" menus from tabs and pills examples (shouldn't have been there in the first place).\n- Replaced `.badge-error` with `.badge-important`. The error option is not a valid class and was a typo in the docs.\n- Fixed mention of how to add plain text to the navbar. Previously the docs stated you only needed a `p` tag, but the required HTML is any element with class `.navbar-text`.\n- Clarified the use of `.tabbable` for tabs. The wrapping class is only required for left and right tabs to clear their floats. Also added mention of `.fade` to fade in tabs.\n- Updated forms documentation:\n  - Remove unnecessary duplicate help text in first example\n  - Added mention of required `input` class, `.search-query`, for the search form variation\n  - Removed incorrect mention of form fields being `display: block;` to start as fields are `inline-block` to start.\n- Added mention of `data-target` attribute for the dropdowns javascript plugin to show how to keep custom URLs intact on links with `.dropdown-toggle` class.\n- Updated the Kippt screenshot on the homepage to reflect their recent responsive redesign and upgrade to 2.0.2.\n"

This was changed to allow the use of `.pull-left` and `.pull-right` to align buttons easily. Double check your button order with this change!\n- Fixed problem where default striped progress bar was green instead of blue.\n- Fixed CSS selector used for `input` and `textarea` grid sizes to properly apply the CSS (was `input > .span*` and now is `input.span*`).\n\n### New features\n- Horizontal dividers support added to nav lists\n- Added basic version of badges\n- Added visible/hidden classes for devices\n- Added support for buttons in input-prepend/append component\n- Added .navbar-fixed-bottom support\n- Added .dropup support for dropdown menus to pop them upward instead of downward (this is automatically done for the newly added fixed bottom navbar).\n- Added mixin for [new image replacement technique](http://www.zeldman.com/2012/03/01/replacing-the-9999px-hack-new-image-replacement/)\n- Added pause on hover for the carousel\n- Added tons of new variables for typography, buttons, forms, dropdowns, navbar, and more for the LESS pros out there. These variables have also been reflected on the Customize page.\n- Added new horizontal description list variation\n- Added `.disabled` class support to the pager component (also added a mention of this to the docs)\n- Added `.well-large` and `.well-small` classes for extending the well component\n"

    "body": "- Previously the docs called for use of `.control-label` in the examples, but the CSS didn't make clear use of it. This class is required for horizontal forms and has been reflected in the CSS.\n- We've tried our best to improve rendering of buttons and icons across all browsers. Some issues remain; Firefox throws an `!important`on `line-height` for inputs, so that's the big one.\n- We refined the label component style to move away from uppercase.\n- Added the black button option, `.btn-inverse`.\n- Added a mini button class, `.btn-mini`.\n- We had to re-add the protocol, `http:` to the HTML5 schim because IE7-8 wouldn't recognize it, dropping some HTML5 support for those browsers and introducing major performance issues.\n- Resolved some issues with responsive layouts where media queries would overlap at 768px and 980px.\n- Rearranged Scaffolding docs page to split fixed and fluid grid systems.\n- Tons of docs updates for typos and language changes.\n"

    "body": "Essentially an entire rewrite of the libraryâ€”docs, CSS, and JavaScript. Adds optional responsive CSS for nearly all components.\n\n### Project changes\n- Docs: major updates across the board to general structure, examples, and code snippets. Also made responsive with new media queries.\n- Docs: all docs pages are now powered by Mustache templates and strings are wrapped in i18n tags for translation by the Twitter Translation Center. All changes to documentation must be done here and then compiled (similar to our CSS and LESS).\n- Repo directory structure: removed the compiled CSS from the root in favor of a large direct download link on the docs homepage. Compiled CSS is in `/docs/assets/css/`.\n- Docs and repo: one makefile, just type `make` in the Terminal and get updated docs and CSS.\n\n### Scaffolding\n\n#### Grid system\n- Updated grid system, now only 12 columns instead of 16\n- Responsive approach means your projects virtually work out of the box on smartphones, tablets, and more\n- Removed unused (by default) grid columns support for 17-24 columns\n\n#### Responsive (media queries)\n- Media queries added for <strong>basic support</strong> across mobile and tablet devices\n- Responsive CSS is compiled separately, as bootstrap-responsive.css\n\n### Base CSS\n\n#### Typography\n- `h4` elements were dropped from 16px to 14px with a default `line-height` of 18px\n- `h5` elements were dropped from 14px to 12px\n- `h6` elements were dropped from 13px to 11px\n- Right-aligned option for blockquotes if `float: right;`\n\n#### Code\n- New graphical style for `&lt;code&gt;`\n- Google Code Prettify styles updated (based on GitHub's gists)\n\n#### Tables\n- Improved support for `colspan` and `rowspan`\n- Styles now restricted to new base class, `.table`\n- Table classes standardized with `.table-` required as a prefix\n- Removed unused table color options (too much code for such little impact)\n- Dropped support for TableSorter\n\n#### Buttons\n- New classes for colors and sizes, all prefixed with `.btn-`\n- IE9: removed gradients and added rounded corners\n- Updated active state to make styling clearer in button groups (new) and look better with custom transition\n- New mixin, `.buttonBackground`, to set button gradients\n\n#### Forms\n- Default form style is now vertical (stacked) to use less CSS and add greater flexibility\n- Form classes standardized with `.form-` required as a prefix\n- New built-in form defaults for search, inline, and horizontal forms\n- More flexible horizontal form markup with classes for all styling, including new optional class for the `label`\n- Form states: colors updated and customizable via new LESS variables\n\n#### Icons, by Glyphicons\n- New Glyphicons Halflings icon set added in sprite form, in black and white\n- Simple markup required for an icon in tons of contexts: `&lt;i class=\"icon-cog\"&gt;&lt;/&gt;`\n- Add another class, `.icon-white`, for white variation of the same icon\n\n### Components\n\n#### Button groups and dropdowns\n- Two brand new components in 2.0: button groups and button dropdowns\n- Dependency: button dropdowns are built on button groups, and therefore require all their styles\n- Button groups, `.btn-group`, can be grouped one level higher with a button toolbar, `.btn-toolbar`\n\n#### Navigation\n- Tabs and pills now require the use of a new base class, `.nav`, on their `&lt;ul&gt;`\n- New nav list variation added that uses the same base class, `.nav`\n- Vertical tabs and pills have been added&mdash;just add `.nav-stacked` to the `&lt;ul&gt;`\n- Pills were restyled to be less rounded by default\n- Pills now have dropdown menu support (they share the same markup and styles as tabs)\n\n#### Navbar (formerly topbar)\n- Base class changed from `.topbar` to `.navbar`\n- Now supports static position (default behavior, not fixed) and fixed to the top of viewport via `.navbar-fixed-top` (previously only supported fixed)\n- Added vertical dividers to top-level nav\n- Improved support for inline forms in the navbar, which now require `.navbar-form` to properly scope styles to only the intended forms.\n- Navbar search form now requires use of the `.navbar-search` class and its input the use of `.search-query`. To position the search form, you <strong>must</strong> use `.pull-left` or `.pull-right`.\n- Added optional responsive markup for collapsing navbar contents for smaller resolutions and devices.\n\n#### Dropdown menus\n- Updated the `.dropdown-menu` to tighten up spacing\n- Now requires you to add a `&lt;span class=\"caret\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;` to show the dropdown arrow\n- The navbar (fixed topbar) has brand new dropdowns. Gone are the dark versions and in their place are the standard white ones with an additional caret at their tops for clarity of position.\n\n#### Labels\n- Label colors updated to match form state colors\n- Not only do they match graphically, but they are powered by the same new variables\n\n#### Thumbnails\n- Formerly `.media-grid`, now just `.thumbnails`, we've thoroughly extended this component for more uses while maintaining overall simplicity out of the box.\n- Individual thumbnails now require `.thumbnail` class\n\n#### Alerts\n- New base class: `.alert` instead of `.alert-message`\n- Class names standardized for other options, now all starting with `.alert-`\n- Redesigned base alert styles to combine the deafult alerts and block-level alerts into one\n- Block level alert class changed: `.alert-block` instead of `.block-message`\n\n#### Progress bars\n- New in 2.0\n- Features multiple styles via classes, including striped and animated variations via CSS3\n\n#### Miscellaneous components\n- Added documentation for the well component and the close icon (used in modals and alerts)\n\n### Javascript plugins\n\nWe're rewritten just about everything for our plugins, so head on over to the Javascript page to learn more.\n\n#### Popovers\n- Child elements now properly namespaced: `.title` to `.popover-title`, `.inner` to `.popover-inner`, and `.content` to `.popover-content`.\n\n#### New plugins\n- Collapse\n- Carousel\n- Typeahead\n"
